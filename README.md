## Module Eight Journal – Reflection for DriverPass Project
**By: Tony Allam**

### DriverPass Project Summary
DriverPass helps students pass their driving tests by offering online practice exams and on-the-road training. I designed system requirements and a software design that supports user accounts, practice tests, scheduling, and security.

### What I Did Well
I translated the client’s needs into clear requirements and created UML diagrams that show both process and object views. My work stayed organized and followed course methods.

### What I Would Improve
I would polish the Business Requirements Document visuals with clearer tables and earlier diagrams to make it faster to understand.

### Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
I used the interview transcript to focus on easy login, practice tests, and training scheduling. Considering user needs is critical—if it’s not usable, it doesn’t meet the goal.

### My Software Design Approach
I break features into small parts and use UML (use case, activity, class diagrams) to check logic before building. I’ll keep using these models to communicate clearly and design better systems.
